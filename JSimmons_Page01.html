					<div id="article1">
						<p>Someday the hard drive on your computer will crash, stranding thousands of songs on your iPod. Here's how to get them back onto your PC or Mac.</p>
						<p><strong>1) Reinstall iTunes.</strong> Launch the app and sign in to your itunes music Store account. Don't plug in your iPod yet.</p>
						<p><strong>2) Install and launch</strong> a free trial of PodUtil from KennettNet software (www.kennettnet.co.uk). The app will sit there idling, displaying a Waiting-for-iPods message.</p>
						<p><strong>3) Plug in your iPod.</strong> PodUtil will detect it and display a window that shows the files and playlists on your ipod. Click the "Choose" button at the bottom of Pod-Util and select your iTunes music folder. Next, click the "Copy Settings" button. In the dialog box that appears, select both "Add Tracks to iTunes" and "Rebuild Playlists." Click "OK."</p>
						<p><strong>4) Read the Don't-Steal-Music warning</strong> in the lower right corner of PodUtil. Think carefully. Click the "Copy" button below it.</p>
						<p><strong>5) Watch as PodUtil copies</strong> your songs, videos, playlists, and podcasts back to your computer and then loads them into iTunes. Reauthorize your iTunes music store tracks. Done!</p>
						<p><strong>6) Happy?</strong> Hit the "Register now" button and send the site &pound;10 (about 18 bucks).</p>

					<h2 class="page1_h2">&#10140;Match Beats&nbsp;&#47;&#47;</h2>
					<p>When mixing two songs, you need to match their speeds. Do this by concentrating on the snare drum: its crisp, distinctive rhythm will help you recognize which song needs to speed up and which needs to slow down. Adjust the tempo of one of the songs until the two are in sync.</p>

					<h3 class="page1_h3">Make a Playlist</h3>
					<p class="make_playlist">The iTunes playlist function makes everyone a DJ. But crafting the perfect soundtrack takes more finesse than just piling a bunch of songs together. <strong>DJ Qbert</strong> (shown), two-time winner of the DMC world DJ championships, drops some science on the art of the mix.</p>
					<ol>
						<li id="pl_tip1"><strong class="strong_list">1</strong> Even Paris Hilton needs a few drinks before she's ready for a dance-off, so your playlist should start off mellow and slowly board the soul train. Figure two hours before you raise the roof.</li>
						<li id="pl_tip2"><strong class="strong_list">2</strong> Soundtracks, like conversations, can be jarring without transitions. Don't attempt to pair Air with Quiet Riot unless you're a professional DJ. Look for songs that complement each other.</li>
						<li id="pl_tip3"><strong class="strong_list">3</strong> Dead space between tracks is for amateurs. Since the iPod can't crossfade, use ProTools to merge tunes into a single song file. If you can match beats, even better.</li>
						<li id="pl_tip4"><strong class="strong_list">4</strong> Be sure to include a few hits. Everyone loves listening to hip new music, but every now and then you gotta get the party moving with an old classic - even if the party's just you.</li>

					<li><strong>1)&nbsp;Join the fan club.</strong> Club memberships often unlock online presale deals.</li>
					<li><strong>2) Coordinate your attack.</strong> Team up with friends so one person hops on Ticketmaster's Web site, one works the phones, and one stands outside an old-fashioned ticket window.</li>
					<li id="ticket_step3"><strong>3) Find the right outlet.</strong> If you're the one schlepping to an actual ticket counter, pick an obscure location. That music store in the exurban mall is often overlooked. But visit ahead of time to make sure someone there knows how to work the machine.</li>
					<li id="ticket_step4"><strong>4) Do a trial run.</strong> Preload your user info on Ticketmaster.com to speed through your purchase on the big day.</li>

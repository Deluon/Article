				<h1 class="page2_h1">Make your blog popular</h1>
				<p><strong>David L. Sifry,</strong> founder and CEO of Technorati, keeps tabs on more than 45 million weblogs. Here's his advice for cracking his site's Top 100 list.</p>
				<div class="pop_blog">
					<p>
						<span class="blog_num">1</span>
						<strong>React quickly.</strong> 
						Commentators like Andrew Sullivan and Michelle Malkin draw megatraffic with immediate rebuttals to A-list pundits at The New York Times and Fox News.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="blog_num">2</span>
						<strong>Make your posts easy to read.</strong> 
						Italian comic Beppe Grillo broke into the Top 10 by setting his key points in boldface.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="blog_num">3</span>
						<strong>Link, link, link!</strong> 
						It's counter-intuitive, but the busiest blogs in Technorati's index are those like InstaPundit.com that link prolifically to other sites. Linking works because most bloggers reciprocate by sending their readers your way.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="blog_num">4</span>
						<strong>Optimize for search engines.</strong> 
						Put the name of your blog (even if it's just your own name) in the main URL and the title tag of your site. On Technorati, identify your blog with search topics, like "politics" or "sewing."
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="blog_num">5</span>
						<strong>Post, post, post!</strong> 
						Chinese actress and director Xu Jinglei has the most popular blog on the planet. At first we thought it was a glitch in our system, but it turns out she's a real-world celebrity who makes time to post almost every day. What's your excuse?

				<h2 class="page2_h2">Improve Your Amazon.com Picks</h2>
				<div id="amazon_picks">
					<strong>Rate items you like.</strong> Sure, it feels good to trash a book you hated, but telling Amazon what you enjoyed will generate better recommendations - and the more, the better. On hold with the cable company? Rate a few items. On a conference call? Rate a few more./ /
					<strong>Remove bum purchases</strong> like the Princess Diaries DVD you bought for your niece last Christmas. Under your personal store tab, select Improve Your Recommendations. Uncheck the Use to Make Recommendations box for items that don't reflect your tastes./ /
					<strong>Squash bad leads.</strong> Amazon doesn't know it's on the wrong track unless you speak up. Click Not Interested and it'll stop insisting you'll love the latest Dave Matthews CD./ /
					<strong>Add any item you want</strong> to your Wish List and Shopping List, even if you aren't ready to buy it - at least Amazon will know your preferences./ /
					<strong>Dig deep</strong> into the recommendations and you might find better ideas. When browsing DVDs, for example, filter down to sub-categories like Animation or Cult Movies for more pics in your favorite genre./ /

			<div id="myspace_article">
				<p><strong>Matthew Price</strong> started MySpace Hacks to "make Myspace do things that it's not supposed to do." These are a few of his fave tools and tips.</p>
				<form id="mysp_custom"><strong class="pg2_strong_titles">Customize your design</strong><br>
				There are thousands of free tools online for tweaking colors, adjusting layouts, and embedding videos. For God's sake, use 'em - the default design on MySpace blows. Just avoid garish scrolling graphics that crash browsers and burn eyeballs.

				<p class="links">&rarr;textforfree.net</p></form>
				<form id="mysp_share"><strong class="pg2_strong_titles">Share your Flickr pics</strong><br>
				MySpace profiles can't display more than 10 photos. Luckily, there's a free download that</form> 
				<form id="mysp_share2">generates a dynamic PNG file that features your six most recent Flickr uploads. When your visitors click a photo, they're taken directly to your Flickr library.

				&rarr;digitalpoint.com/tools/geovisitors</form>
				<form id="mysp_friends"><strong class="pg2_strong_titles">Add more friends to your main page</strong><br>
				MySpace's standard settings display eight favorite friends on your profile home-page. The MySpace Custom Friend Space Generator lets you rework the field to show off up to 40 of your BFFs.<br>
